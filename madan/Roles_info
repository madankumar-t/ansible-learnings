Components of a role 

1. Defaults : data about the application / default variable will be stored , which we can use when we use templates
2. files : static files are stored here which need to be added to the host machine 
3. handlers : tasks which are based on some actions.  in case my httpd.conf changes it should trigger service restart 
4. meta : as the name shows it will provide information about the role author name, supported platforms , dependencies 
5. tasks : core logic will be stored here , installing package , copying files etc
6. templates : similar to files except that template support modification, jinga2 template language
7. vars : both vars and defaults stores variables, variable stored under var got higher priority , difficult to override
execution starts from tasks main.yaml file , we can include multiple yaml files and can include in main.yaml file
